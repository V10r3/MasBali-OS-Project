/* This is a a CPU Scheduling Visualization Project, this simulates how your device, deciedes on 
/ process to be allocated for the execution, this includes:
1. First-In First-Out (FIFO / FCFS)
   -the Jobs are proccessed in order
   -once the job starts, there is no interuptions.
   -long jobs can delay shorter jobs
2. Shortest Job First (SJF) – Non-Preemptive
   -Selects the job with the smallest burst time
   -Jobs will complete, no interuptions
4. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) – Preemptive
   -Picks the least remaining time
   -when a shorter job arrives, it preempts the current one
6. Round Robin
   -Each gets a fixd time slice, quantum
   -Switches context after every time slice
8. Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
   -This has multiple queues, having priority and time quanta
   -The jobs moves between queues based on the behavior; burst and cpu usage

Balista- Both of us have worked together on the 5 Algorithms and made the html look clean
Mascardo- Created the HTML with the help of Balista's input
