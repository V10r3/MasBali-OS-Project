This is a CPU Scheduling Visualization, in here we are gonaa be showing a simulation of how each 
algorithm is being used by your device:
First-In First-Out (FIFO / FCFS)
-The Jobs are process in order at which they arrive
-No interruptions, one job must be finish to continue the rest
-Simple, long jobs may take a while to finish

Shortest Job First (SJF) – Non-Preemptive
-Select the job with the smallest burst time
-once job starts, it completes uninterrupted
-Great for minimizing waiting and turnaround time

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) – Preemptive
-This always picks the job that has least remaining time
- if a shorter process arrives, it preempts the current
  
Round Robin
-each process has a fixed time slice, quantum then cycles
-this switches context after every time slice

Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
-Mutilple queues with varied priority levels
-the process moves between queues 

Member roles/contrubutions
Balista - both members have done all equal algorithms as we were having a hard time. 
          HTML was improved based on Mascardo initial design
Mascardo - Checking of accurate simulation and improvements of HTML Desgin and flow
